# ChatFlow 👁️

**The Vision-Enhanced, Stealth-First WhatsApp Automation Library**

**ChatFlow** is a production-grade automation library for WhatsApp Web. Unlike fragile DOM-based bots that break when WhatsApp updates their CSS, ChatFlow uses a **Hybrid Computer Vision Engine** to visually verify actions.

It was engineered specifically to solve the "Ghost Click" and "RTL Mirroring" issues common in Arabic/Hebrew automation, making it the most reliable choice for multilingual support.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **👁️ Visual Verification Protocol**  
  Most bots assume a message is sent after clicking "Enter". ChatFlow **watches** the screen using OpenCV. It detects the gray "Clock" icon and waits specifically for it to turn into a "Tick" before proceeding.

- **🌍 Native Arabic/RTL Support**  
  Handles mirrored interfaces automatically. No need to switch your phone's language to English.

- **📎 Universal Media Clipboard**  
  Uses OS-level clipboard injection (`CF_HDROP`) to send **PDFs, Images, Videos, and Audio** files without navigating complex attachment menus.

- **👻 Stealth Listening**  
  Reads incoming messages from the sidebar **without opening the chat**. This allows you to filter messages (White-List) without triggering the "Blue Ticks" for unwanted contacts.

- **🛡️ Anti-Ban Safeguards**
  - **Randomized Delays:** Simulates human thinking time between bulk actions
  - **UI Hard Resets:** Presses `ESC` twice between actions to ensure the interface is never stuck in a "Search" or "Selected" state
  - **Human Mouse Curves:** Uses `pyautogui` to simulate natural mouse movement rather than instant teleportation

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Install the package

```bash
pip install chatflow-bot
```

### 2. Install Playwright Browsers

ChatFlow uses a dedicated Chromium instance (not your personal Chrome) to ensure a clean session.

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows (recommended for Clipboard features), macOS, or Linux

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. The Basics

When you run ChatFlow for the first time, a browser window will open. You must scan the QR code with your phone. The session is saved locally in `./wa_session`, so you only need to scan once.

```python
from chatflow import ChatFlow

# headless=False lets you watch the bot work (Recommended for debugging)
bot = ChatFlow(headless=False)

# Send a simple text
bot.send_message("201202324408", "Hello World!")

# Close the browser safely
bot.close()
```

### 2. Sending Files (Universal)

You don't need to tell ChatFlow if it's an image or a PDF. Just provide the path.

```python
# Send a PDF Invoice
bot.send_message("201202324408", "Here is the invoice", media_path="C:/docs/invoice_2024.pdf")

# Send a Video
bot.send_message("201202324408", "Check this out!", media_path="C:/media/demo.mp4")
```

---

## 🔥 Advanced Usage

### 📢 Bulk Broadcaster (Anti-Ban Mode)

Use this for marketing or notifications. It iterates through a list of contacts with safety delays.

```python
contacts = [
    {"phone": "201000000000", "message": "Hello Alice", "media_path": "promo.jpg"},
    {"phone": "201000000001", "message": "Hello Bob"},  # No media
    {"phone": "201000000002", "message": "Hello Charlie"}
]

bot = ChatFlow()

# min_delay=10, max_delay=25
# This ensures the bot waits 10-25 seconds randomly between messages.
bot.send_bulk(contacts, min_delay=10, max_delay=25)

bot.close()
```

## 📚 API Reference

### `ChatFlow(session_dir, headless)`

**Parameters:**
- `session_dir` (str): Path to store the browser session (cookies/login). Default: `./wa_session`
- `headless` (bool): Run without a visible UI. Default: `False`  
  *Note: WhatsApp Web often requires a visible UI for proper rendering.*

---

### `send_message(phone, message, media_path)`

Sends a single message.

**Parameters:**
- `phone` (str): The phone number (with country code, no `+`)
- `message` (str): The text caption or message body
- `media_path` (str, optional): Absolute path to a file

---

### `send_bulk(contacts, min_delay, max_delay)`

Sends messages to a list.

**Parameters:**
- `contacts` (list): A list of dictionaries `{'phone': '...', 'message': '...'}`
- `min_delay` (int): Minimum seconds to sleep between chats
- `max_delay` (int): Maximum seconds to sleep between chats

---

### `start_listening(callback_func, allowed_users, check_interval)`

Starts an infinite loop to monitor incoming messages.

**Parameters:**
- `callback_func`: A function `f(text, sender)` that returns a string (reply) or `None`
- `allowed_users` (list): A list of exact names (as they appear in the sidebar) to reply to
- `check_interval` (int): Seconds to wait between sidebar scans

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Calibration

### 1. "Send Button Not Found"

ChatFlow uses an image asset (`assets/send_icon.png`) to find the button. If your screen resolution or scaling (DPI) is different, detection might fail.

**Fix:** Take a screenshot of your own "Send" button (the green paper plane), crop it, and replace the file in `chatflow/assets/send_icon.png`.

---

### 2. "Message Stuck on Clock"

If the log says "Clock detected" but it never verifies success:

**Cause:** Slow internet or the "Clock" icon looks different on your OS.

**Fix:** Replace `chatflow/assets/clock_icon.png` with a screenshot of the clock icon from your computer.

---

### 3. "Clipboard Error"

**Cause:** Trying to send media on Linux/Mac without the proper clipboard tools.

**Fix:** This feature is optimized for Windows (`pywin32`). On Linux, ensure `xclip` is installed.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Explained

ChatFlow uses a **Multi-Scale Template Matching** algorithm:

1. **Capture:** It takes a screenshot of the browser viewport
2. **Scale:** It resizes the "Target Icon" (Send button) to 10 different sizes (from 80% to 120%)
3. **Match:** It scans the screen for the best match. This allows the bot to work even if your browser zoom level is slightly off
